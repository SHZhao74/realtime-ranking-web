## 純 JS 實現即時投票排名系統

## Motivation

My boss had a big birthday dinner for his 30th birthday in which we set up a detective game to find the spy.

Therefore, I implement a simple system to present the vote counting result.
Practice and try to use Vite at a meanwhile.

## Getting Start

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Features

1. support two runtime (front stage and back stage) exchange data via localStorage.
2. Updating votes animation
3. design for 1920x1080 resolution
4. click front stage Logo will stop automatic updating and remove spies from candidates.
